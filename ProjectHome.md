Arduino-Tiny is an open source set of ATtiny "cores" for the Arduino platform.

The Arduino platform currently supports Atmel ATmega processors.  There is a need for the Arduino platform to work with physically smaller DIP package processors.  The intent of this project is fulfill that need.  Specifically, our goal is to provide a core that enables Arduino users to work with the ATtiny84 (84/44/24), ATtiny85 (85/45/25), and ATtiny2313 (4313) processors.

(Thank you to everyone above!)

(Apologies to anyone missing from the list.  Anyone not included is simply a lack of awareness on my part.)
